# Facial Feature Point Detection Seminar Notebook

This is the notebook and accompanying images I used for my ACM
student chapter seminar on 20/10/2014 at Imperial College London.

Note that this Notebook requires menpo==0.4.0 which at the time of
this commit has yet to be released. When Menpo is released in the
near future, this notebook will then be runnable assuming
you have downloaded the 
[LFPW dataset](http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/download/annotations/lfpw.zip)
and changed the paths inside the notebooks.

You also don't have my pre-trained HOG model as it is too big to share
in git. However, you could use the notebooks over on 
[menpo.io](http://www.menpo.io) to train a HOG model and then change
the path inside seminar.py.

Thanks for the interest!
